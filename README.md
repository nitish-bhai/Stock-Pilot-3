StockPilot is a voice-enabled inventory management system built for small shop owners who struggle with manual stock updates. Instead of typing or navigating complex apps, users can simply speak naturally in English or Hindi to add, remove, check, or update stock.

It works fully in the browser, requires no installation, and updates inventory in real time across all devices.

Why we built it-

From our research, we found three major issues faced by small retailers:

1. They don't have time to manually update inventory while handling customers.

2. Most digital tools are too complex, require typing, or are English-heavy.

3. Small errors accumulate into financial losses, like missing reorders or incorrect stock counts.

-We built StockPilot to solve this with a system that is:

Hands-free

Fast and intuitive

Local-language friendly

Accessible on any device

As easy as talking to a helper

Our mission was to make Inventory management simple, human, and error-free for millions of small shop owners.

How it works-

StockPilot combines three technologies:

1. Vapi Al-Voice Command Understanding

Understands natural speech like:

"Add ten Pepsi."

"Remove five Maggie."

"Check stock for cola."

2. Agora RTM-Real-Time Messaging

Ensures instant sync between devices and between sellers & suppliers, with zero backend setup.

3. Firebase Real-Time Database

Stores and updates inventory instantly, so every staff member sees the same Information.
